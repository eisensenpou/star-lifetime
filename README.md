# Star Lifetime Simulator

## Overview

The Star Lifetime Simulator is a program that estimates the lifetime of a star based on its mass and other physical properties. It uses numerical integration methods to calculate the total energy output of a star over time, and then estimates the time it will take for the star to exhaust its fuel.

## Features

- Estimate the lifetime of a star based on its mass and other physical properties.
- Generate a table of stellar lifetimes for a range of masses.
- Compare the lifetimes of different stars.

## Installation

To install the Star Lifetime Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-lifetime-simulator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd star-lifetime-simulator`
3. Build the project: `cmake .` and `make`
4. Run the program: `./star_lifetime`

## Usage

To use the Star Lifetime Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Choose an option from the menu:
   - 1. Estimate the lifetime of a star
   - 2. Generate a lifetime table
   - 3. Compare multiple stars
2. Follow the prompts to enter the necessary information:
   - For option 1, enter the stellar mass in solar masses.
   - For option 2, enter the number of masses to generate lifetimes for.
   - For option 3, enter the names and masses of the stars you want to compare.
3. View the results on the console.
